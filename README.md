# svg-scroll-animated-landingpage
My try on a scroll animated landing page with a background movie.

Currently hosted at [svg.schneider.today](https://svg.schneider.today).

# How to use
The background movie can be changed in the html source tag. The svg in the css file at .banner #bg.
If there is no content, the scroll won't work. In this case a min-height is required.

If you'd like to host the current solution on a webserver, check the .htaccess file as it routes to https.
